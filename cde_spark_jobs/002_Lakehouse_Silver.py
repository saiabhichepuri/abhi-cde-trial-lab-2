#The cherrypick_snapshot procedure creates a new snapshot incorporating the changes from another snapshot in a metadata-only operation
#(no new datafiles are created). To run the cherrypick_snapshot procedure you need to provide two parameters:
#the name of the table you’re updating as well as the ID of the snapshot the table should be updated based on.
#This transaction will return the snapshot IDs before and after the cherry-pick operation as source_snapshot_id and current_snapshot_id.
#we will use the cherrypick operation to commit the changes to the table which were staged in the 'ing_branch' branch up until now.

# SHOW PAST BRANCH SNAPSHOT ID'S
